## Haku33
Perform a Hard Reset of the switch, and leave it as if it had just left the factory 

## Reason
* In case you don't have a clean copy of the nand, clean it and start using all original or use emunand

## Disclaimer
* It is advisable to make a backup before using it, since despite being well tested failures can occur
* The premise is elimination. Can it be the lack of info that makes you get banned? so far the case has not occurred
* True that it is not 100% safe but the people who have tested it have not yet been banned
* If you have a clean backup of the Nand it is better that, and under no circumstances use this in switch IPatched
* If your console is Banned there is nothing to do
* This will completely clean your switch so you will lose everything
