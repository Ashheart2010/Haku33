## Haku33
Perform a Hard Reset of the switch, and leave it as if it had just left the factory

## Reason
* In case you don't have a clean copy of the nand, clean it and start using all original or use emunand

## Disclaimer
* It is advisable to make a backup before using it, since despite being well tested failures can occur
* The premise is elimination. Can it be the lack of info that makes you get banned? so far the case has not occurred
* True that it is not 100% safe but the people who have tested it have not yet been banned
* If you have a clean backup of the Nand it is better that, and under no circumstances use this in switch IPatched
* If your console is Banned there is nothing to do
* This will completely clean your switch so you will lose everything
### Note:
Keep in mind that this program will not UNBAN you, nor will it make you immune to BAN.
You will have a console as just out of the box that's it.
So you can go online as long as you keep the console clean of cfw .
* * It is a program that temporarily stops critical console services.
So if it freezes, you should heed the warnings on the screen before asking for support.
* * It is extremely rare that your console get a error even if the program fails, press 15s the Power will be enough
* * I recommend having a backup of the nand for security reasons
